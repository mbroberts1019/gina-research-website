title: How can we model the rotation effect?

description: >-
  The rotation effect has been known since the beginning of agriculture - the
  same crop grown continuously yields less than the same crop rotated with
  another. But why is still somewhat of a mystery...

Working with crop models can help us examine phenomena in a detailed way. We are trying to parse out the rotation effect into bio-physical effects that can be captured in a process-based model (APSIM).
