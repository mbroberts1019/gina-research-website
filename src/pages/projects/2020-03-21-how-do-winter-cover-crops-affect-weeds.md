title: How do winter cover crops affect weeds?

description: >-
  Winter cover cropping in the US Midwest is good for soil health and water
  quality, but can it also help control weeds? We used a meta-analysis coupled
  with field measurements to see.

The Midwestern region of the United States produces an insane amount of corn - around a third of the world's production comes from these 12 states. Much of that corn is produced using a rotation of corn and soybean, both of which are planted in the spring (April/May) and harvested in the fall (Oct/Nov), leaving the ground bare over the winter.  Using winter cover crops as part of this rotation protects the soil from erosion and soaks up extra nutrients in the spring before the main crop is planted (thus keeping those nutrients out of our water). However, these benefits are hard to monetize.  Many people wonder if cover crops can reduce weed control costs. 

To answer that question my colleagues and I used two approaches: 

1. We gathered up all of the studies done in the Midwest that looked at the effect cover cropping in a corn-soybean rotation had on weeds. We put them into a database (which you can access for free here) and summarized them. We found on average, **cover crops reduce the size of weeds in a field, but do not reduce the number of weeds**. Smaller weeds are easier to kill, and they produce less seeds.  This made us wonder whether long-term use of a cover crop can reduce the number of weeds over time, because all of the studies in our database were only 2 years old. This led us to the second approach. 
2. Through the Practical Farmers of Iowa network, we found three farms running experiments with corn-soybean rotations that included a cover crop and a control. The experiments had been in place over 10 years and had replicates of each treatment (a true science treasure!). We sampled the weed seedbanks on those farms and found that indeed, **long-term cover cropping reduced the size of the weed seedbank**.
