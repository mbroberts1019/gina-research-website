title: Does Mustard Seed Community Farm have compaction issues?

description: >-
  I volunteer at Mustard Seed Community Farm most summers. They give me
  vegetables, and I do science! I recently went and took penetrometer
  measurements (with some helpers).  I'm processing the data, but expect a Shiny
  App soon....

Soil compaction is a real concern for a lot of farmers. The [Archontoulis Lab](https://www.archontoulislab.com/) was generous enough to let me use our penetrometer to measure soil compaction on several fields around Mustard Seed.
