### Scientific Audiences 👩🏾‍🔬

#### *Papers*

For published papers 📄 see my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h4roCDAAAAAJ&hl=en). Google is better at keeping track than I am. 

#### *Datasets*

I am proud to have published the data from many of my research projects, making them more reproducible. Those datasets 📊 are available here:

* [Field data](https://iastate.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Long_Term_Cover_Cropping_Effects_on_Weed_Seedbanks/12762011/1) on the effects of long-term cover cropping on weed seedbanks
* [Dataset used for a meta-analysis](https://iastate.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Effect_of_cover_crops_on_weed_biomass_and_density_in_the_US_Midwest_Corn_Belt_meta-analysis_dataset/11933214) on effects of cover cropping on weeds
* [Dataset used for a meta-analysis](https://iastate.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Effect_of_crop_rotation_on_weed_biomass_and_density_literature_summary/7771010) on effects of crop sequence diversification on weeds

The analyses accompanying the datasets are available on [my github page](https://github.com/vanichols), which is admittedly a bit of a mess right now. 

#### *Resources*

* [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2kj0UmZC6o_C27eASx1SJg) for LunchinatoRs 🥪, an Iowa State University community R learning group I help(ed) organize.
* [A walk-through](https://github.com/vanichols/dataManagement/blob/master/How-to-set-up-Github-with-RStudio.pdf) of setting up git and RStudio on a PC 💻
