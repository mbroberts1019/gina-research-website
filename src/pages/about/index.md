### Public Research
I am currently a PhD student at Iowa State University, studying under the tutelage of Drs. Sotirios Archontoulis and Matt Liebman. Generally, I'm interested in examining the impacts of diversifying crop rotations to include more than two crops (which is more of an alteration than a rotation). I use R and APSIM to help with these endeavors. 

### Farmer Collaborators
We are lucky in Ames to have the [Practical Farmers of Iowa](https://practicalfarmers.org/) close by, so I often rely on them to connect me with farmers for some aspects of my research. 

### Teaching
I developed a new class at Iowa State University to help ease students into using R in a welcoming environment. And by using R I mean using the [tidyverse!](https://www.tidyverse.org/) We even have our own hexsticker to show we are Rgronomists (see Teaching tab for more info).

let sassTeacherAboutAssignment = new SassObject
sassTeacherAboutAssignment.complaints = [
  'stupid',
  'off topic',
  'inherently chauvinistic',
  'waste of my time'
]
forEach(sassTeacherAboutAssignment.complaints){
  console.log(complaint)
}
```
