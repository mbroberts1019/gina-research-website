### Scientific Audiences

*Papers*

See my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h4roCDAAAAAJ&hl=en). Google is better at keeping track than I am. 

I did try doing a pre-print for one paper, and that one is a google-mess. The actual open-source, published version can be found [here](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ael2.20022). 

*Datasets*

I am proud to have published the data from many of my research projects, making them more reproducible. Those datasets are available here:
* [Field data](https://iastate.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Long_Term_Cover_Cropping_Effects_on_Weed_Seedbanks/12762011/1) on the effects of long-term cover cropping on weed seedbanks
* [Dataset used for a meta-analysis](https://iastate.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Effect_of_cover_crops_on_weed_biomass_and_density_in_the_US_Midwest_Corn_Belt_meta-analysis_dataset/11933214) on effects of cover cropping on weeds
* [Dataset used for a meta-analysis](https://iastate.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Effect_of_crop_rotation_on_weed_biomass_and_density_literature_summary/7771010) on effects of crop sequence diversification on weeds

The analyses accompanying the datasets are available on [my github page](https://github.com/vanichols), which is admittedly a bit of a mess right now.
